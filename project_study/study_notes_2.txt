It is used by processes to create the processes that are copies of themselves. 
With the help of such system calls, a child process can be created by the parent process.
Until the child process is executed completely, the parent process is suspended.
*  The  child process and the parent process run in separate memory spaces.
* On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is
returned  in  the child.  On failure, -1 is returned in the parent, no child
process is created,
